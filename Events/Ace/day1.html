        <h3>Tips</h3>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>Use a 50% Gathering Speedup from the alliance store before sending the first group out</li>
                <li>Send you max march size of troops to the resource gathering building 18 or so hours before the event and leave them there.  You can check to see how long it will take them to gather in full and time it so they leave the alliance resource building to come back home 10 or so minutes after the reset and start of ACE day 1</li>
                <li>If you are VIP 10 then make sure to switch your talents to an Economy build before sending any units out</li>
                <li>If you have access to the active ability <b>Swift Gatherer</b> in the Economy talent tree then make sure to use it after you send out your max number of marches and they arrive at full nodes.  Note this talent does not work with the Alliance Resource building or Rare Earth</li>
